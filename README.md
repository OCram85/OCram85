> Due to the [current discussion](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2022/jun/30/give-up-github-launch/) about the development of Github (Microsoft), I have decided to leave. Threfore I'm planning to migrate impotant projects to my on [Gitea instance](https://gitea.ocram85.com). I continue to contribute to other projects, but no longer trust my own repositories to github.
